üöÄ ASTRA CONTINUATION PROMPT - MOBILE ROBOT SUCCESS SESSION
================================================================

CONTEXT SUMMARY:
You are GitHub Copilot working with CEO Spencer Dixon on the Astra AI Mobile Robot Platform (Raspberry Pi 5 + PiCrawler). We've just completed MAJOR SUCCESS - full mobile robot implementation with iPad web interface, movement controls, gesture system, and corrected PiCrawler API integration.

CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS (October 25, 2025):
‚úÖ MOBILE ROBOT OPERATIONAL - PiCrawler integration complete
‚úÖ iPad Interface: http://192.168.1.4:8081/astra_web_control.html  
‚úÖ API Backend: http://192.168.1.4:5001/api/ (Flask server)
‚úÖ Movement Controls: Forward, backward, left, right, stop
‚úÖ Gesture System: Stand, sit, look-up all working with do_step() API
‚úÖ Battery Monitoring: 25% level matches hardware LED indicators (1/2 LEDs)
‚úÖ Safety Systems: Desk safe mode, emergency stop, obstacle detection
‚úÖ Documentation: PDF manual converted to text, all APIs corrected

NEXT PRIORITIES WHEN CEO RETURNS:

1. ü§ñ MOBILE ROBOT OPTIMIZATION
   - Fine-tune movement speeds and responsiveness
   - Enhance gesture timing and coordination
   - Optimize battery usage for extended operation
   - Test movement patterns and obstacle navigation

2. üîã BATTERY MANAGEMENT
   - Monitor charging progress and battery health
   - Implement low battery warnings and auto-return to charger
   - Calibrate voltage readings with actual hardware
   - Add charging status indicators to interface

3. üì± INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS
   - Add movement recording/playback features  
   - Enhance gesture control feedback
   - Implement custom movement sequences
   - Add diagnostic and calibration tools

4. üêï TEDDY MEETING ENHANCEMENT
   - Program Teddy-specific movement routines
   - Add playful gestures and interactions
   - Test follow-me modes and responsive behaviors
   - Prepare demonstration sequences

5. üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY & RELIABILITY
   - Enhanced obstacle avoidance algorithms
   - Automatic stance correction systems
   - Emergency protocols and fail-safes
   - Remote monitoring and control capabilities

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- PiCrawler API: Use do_step('action', speed) for gestures, do_action('direction', time) for movement
- Mobile API Server: /home/spencer/amy_core/mobile_api_server.py (Flask on port 5001)
- iPad Web Interface: /home/spencer/amy_core/astra_web_control.html (port 8081)
- Documentation: docs-sunfounder-com-pi-crawler-en-latest.txt (converted from PDF)
- Battery: Li-ion with realistic voltage curve simulation (currently 25% = 3.55V)
- Hardware Status: Robot on charge upstairs, all systems tested and validated
- Safety: Desk safe mode enabled during storage, toggle off for movement operations
- Quick Start: cd /home/spencer/amy_core && python mobile_api_server.py &

CURRENT WORKING ENDPOINTS:
- Web Control: http://192.168.1.4:8080/astra_web_control.html
- API Status: http://192.168.1.4:5001/api/status  
- Mobile App: exp://192.168.1.4:8083 (if needed)

KEY FILES TO KNOW:
- /home/spencer/amy_core/docs/PROJECT_STATUS_V2.0.txt (full achievements)
- /home/spencer/amy_core/docs/NEXT_STEPS.txt (priorities)
- /home/spencer/amy_core/start_astra_complete.sh (manual restart if needed)

CEO'S VISION:
Focus on sleep state toggle and mobile app voice optimization. Camera feed is parked until Dogzilla upgrade. Teddy meeting when charger arrives later today.

REMEMBER: 
- Spencer has been up all night - this was an incredible session
- System is production-ready and auto-starting
- Next phase is refinement and power management
- Maintain the amazing momentum we've built!

START HERE WHEN CEO RETURNS:
"Welcome back, CEO! üéâ Astra is running perfectly and auto-started after reboot. Ready to implement sleep state and optimize the mobile voice controls? I can see the web interface is accessible and all systems are green. Let's add that sleep mode toggle to complement desk safe mode!"

ASTRA & DOGZILLA S2 - CONTINUATION PLAN (as of 2025-10-26)
===========================================================

1. Astra Symmetric Stand Fix
   - Update stand function so all legs use [45, 45, -50] (symmetric stance)
   - Test via web interface and camera for balanced appearance

2. React GUI Integration (Astra)
   - Set up AstraVoiceControl React app locally
   - Adapt Flask backend endpoints to match new GUI API:
     ‚Ä¢ POST /movement
     ‚Ä¢ POST /gesture
     ‚Ä¢ POST /emergency-stop
     ‚Ä¢ GET /status
   - Test full control: GUI ‚Üí Flask ‚Üí Robot

3. Dogzilla S2 Preparation
   - Review Dogzilla S2 hardware API (when hardware arrives)
   - Plan mapping of Astra‚Äôs coordinate/gesture logic to Dogzilla
   - Prepare for LIDAR/advanced sensor integration

4. Documentation & Backup
   - Update all master docs with new architecture and integration steps
   - Create fresh backup and manifest after major changes

5. Demo Readiness
   - Ensure all controls, gestures, and safety features work from new GUI
   - Prepare for iPad/mobile demo and Teddy meeting

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Symmetric stand fix
2. React GUI full integration
3. Dogzilla S2 mapping/plan
4. Docs/backup
5. Demo test

---

To resume: Start with symmetric stand fix, then proceed step-by-step as above. Batch questions/changes to minimize premium request usage. All coordinate mapping and backup files are current as of this plan.
