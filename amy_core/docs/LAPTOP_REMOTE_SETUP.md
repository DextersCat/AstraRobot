## üöÄ TESTING YOUR SETUP

### **Test 1: Basic Connection**
```bash
# In VS Code terminal (connected to Amy)
pwd                    # Should show: /home/spencer/amy_core
ls -la                # Should show Amy's files
systemctl status amy   # Check Astra service status
```

### **Test 2: Run Amy Commands**
```bash
# Test voice pipeline components
cd /home/spencer/amy_core
source env/venv_guard.sh
python3 amy_wake.py    # Should show Porcupine loading
```

### **Test 3: Control Interface**
```bash
# Test button interface for reliable control
python3 button_interface.py
# Try commands: time, wave, status, test
```

## üìÅ RECOMMENDED WORKSPACE STRUCTURE

**On your laptop, create a local folder structure:**
```
C:/AstraProjects/          (Windows)
~/AstraProjects/           (Mac/Linux)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ amy_backup/            # Local backup copies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dogzilla_prep/         # Tuesday preparation files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation/         # Project notes and guides
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ development/           # Local testing and development
```

## üîÑ SYNCHRONIZATION STRATEGY

### **Option 1: Direct Remote Editing (Recommended)**
- **Edit files directly on Amy via VS Code Remote-SSH**
- **All changes happen in real-time on Amy**
- **No sync issues, always up-to-date**

### **Option 2: Git-Based Workflow**
```bash
# On Amy (set up git repository)
cd /home/spencer/amy_core
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Amy core backup"

# Create backup branch before major changes
git checkout -b pre-dogzilla-backup
```

### **Option 3: Periodic Backups**
```bash
# From laptop, backup Amy's files
rsync -avz spencer@192.168.1.4:/home/spencer/amy_core/ ./amy_backup/
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### **Connection Problems:**
```bash
# Test basic SSH connection
ssh spencer@192.168.1.4

# Check Amy's IP hasn't changed
ping amy.local

# Restart SSH service on Amy if needed
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### **VS Code Remote Issues:**
1. **Reload window:** Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"
2. **Reconnect:** Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"
3. **Clear VS Code Server:** Delete `~/.vscode-server` on Amy and reconnect

ssh-copy-id spencer@192.168.1.4

# Check SSH key permissions on laptop
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
