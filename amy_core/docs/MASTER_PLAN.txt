PROJECT: Amy Voice Assistant (Pi 5 • Debian Trixie • Python 3.13.5)
DATE: 2025-10-23
REVISION: v1.0 (Golden Snapshot Baseline)

PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION & RUNTIME INTEGRITY
------------------------------------------------------------
Block A — Environment Validation .......... COMPLETE
Block B — Unified Environment Control ..... COMPLETE
Block C — Runtime Integrity Checks ........ COMPLETE

Golden Snapshot V1.0:
  Manifest: ~/logs/checks/amy_snapshot_GOLDEN_V1.0_2025-10-23_200201.manifest
  Archive : ~/monty_backups/archives/amy_snapshot_GOLDEN_V1.0_2025-10-23_200201.tar.gz
  Verified by CEO (Spencer)
  Status: PASS (Audit + Service Health Verified)

PHASE 2 — KEYWORD & INTENT VALIDATION
------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
  Validate wake word "Astra" triggers Amy and routes correctly to intent parsing.

Scope:
  • Confirm Porcupine wake word "Astra" detection.
  • Confirm verbal response to “What's the time?” via Piper (Amy voice).
  • Ensure no false triggers; single active process only.
  • Capture timing data: detection → response latency.

Cadence:
  1. Observe: Daily audit @09:00 via amy_audit.sh (must PASS).
  2. Check: Wake word file presence (astra.ppn) + mic readiness.
  3. Test: Run keyword → time intent; record evidence log.
  4. Run: Enable continuous mode after confirmed PASS.

Evidence:
  All Phase 2 test logs stored under ~/logs/checks/phase2_*.log

Risk Controls:
  • No unverified edits; proof via manifest only.
  • No silent audio changes.
  • All new intents logged + timestamped.

CTO Directive 001-A:
  “No Drift, No Guesswork — Proof before Action.”

Next Actions:
  • 09:00 Audit check (expect PASS)
  • Prepare and run Phase 2 Test Block 1 — “Astra → What’s the time?”
  • Log outcome to TECHNICAL_LEDGER.txt
