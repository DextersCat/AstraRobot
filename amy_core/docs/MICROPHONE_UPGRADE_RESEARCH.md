# Microphone Upgrade Research for Amy Voice Assistant
**Current Issue**: C-Media Electronics USB Audio Adapter (Unitek Y-247A) - NOT suitable for desk-distance STT

## üé§ **Recommended Microphone Upgrades**

### **Option 1: Blue Yeti Nano (¬£60-80)** ‚≠ê **BEST VALUE**
- **Pickup Pattern**: Cardioid (directional, focuses on voice)
- **Range**: 2-4 feet optimal for speech recognition
- **Features**: Built-in headphone monitoring, USB-C
- **Why Better**: Designed specifically for voice recording vs generic audio adapter
- **Weight**: 600g (acceptable for robot mounting)

### **Option 2: Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB (¬£70-90)** ‚≠ê **PROFESSIONAL**
- **Type**: Dynamic microphone (excellent noise rejection)
- **Range**: 1-3 feet optimal, but much better pickup than current
- **Features**: USB + XLR outputs, built-in headphone jack
- **Why Better**: Broadcast-quality dynamic mic, rejects background noise
- **Weight**: 550g

### **Option 3: Samson Go Mic (¬£30-40)** ‚≠ê **BUDGET SOLUTION**
- **Type**: Compact condenser with cardioid pattern
- **Range**: 1-2 feet optimal
- **Features**: Clip-on design, very portable
- **Why Better**: Actual microphone vs audio adapter
- **Weight**: 100g (very light for robot)

### **Option 4: ModMic Wireless (¬£120)** ‚≠ê **ULTIMATE SOLUTION**
- **Type**: Wireless headset microphone
- **Range**: Consistent 6+ inches from mouth
- **Features**: Wireless, boom arm, noise cancellation
- **Why Better**: Always optimal distance, hands-free
- **Weight**: Negligible (worn, not mounted)

## üîç **Technical Comparison**

| Microphone | Price | Range | Weight | STT Quality | Background Noise |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Current (Unitek)** | ¬£60* | <1ft | Unknown | ‚ùå Poor | ‚ùå Very sensitive |
| **Blue Yeti Nano** | ¬£70 | 2-4ft | 600g | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate |
| **ATR2100x-USB** | ¬£80 | 1-3ft | 550g | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Great |
| **Samson Go Mic** | ¬£35 | 1-2ft | 100g | ‚úÖ Good | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate |
| **ModMic Wireless** | ¬£120 | Always optimal | 0g | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚úÖ Excellent |

*\*You were overcharged - Unitek Y-247A typically costs ¬£15-25*

## üí° **Why Your Current Device Fails**

The **Unitek Y-247A** is:
- ‚ùå **Audio adapter**, not a microphone (has 3.5mm ports)
- ‚ùå **Designed for headphones/speakers**, not voice capture
- ‚ùå **Omnidirectional pickup** (picks up everything equally)
- ‚ùå **No voice optimization** (flat frequency response)
- ‚ùå **Poor signal-to-noise ratio** at distance

## üéØ **Recommendation**

### **Immediate Solution**: **Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB**
**Why this is perfect for Amy:**
1. **Dynamic microphone** = excellent background noise rejection
2. **USB connection** = plug-and-play with Raspberry Pi
3. **1-3 foot range** = perfect for desk usage
4. **Broadcast quality** = designed for speech recognition
5. **Durable** = can handle robot mounting/movement
6. **Future-proof** = XLR output for professional audio interfaces later

### **Budget Alternative**: **Samson Go Mic**
- **¬£35 vs ¬£120** for the ATR2100x
- **Much lighter** for robot mounting
- **Still infinitely better** than current audio adapter
- **Proven track record** for STT applications

## üì¶ **What You Should Return/Exchange**

If you bought the Unitek as a "USB microphone":
1. **Return it immediately** - it's not fit for purpose
2. **Claim mis-selling** if sold as "microphone for voice recognition"
3. **Get refund** and put towards proper microphone

## üöÄ **Expected Improvement**

With a proper microphone, you should see:
- ‚úÖ **3-4 foot reliable STT range** (vs current <1 foot)
- ‚úÖ **95%+ transcription accuracy** (vs current garbled results)
- ‚úÖ **Background noise immunity** (vs current sensitivity)
- ‚úÖ **No need for enhancement processing** (vs current complex sox pipeline)

**Bottom Line**: ChatGPT recommended a ¬£60 audio adapter when you needed a ¬£70 proper microphone. The ¬£10 difference would have solved everything!
