  ✅ Proper Astra voice (no more robot voice fallback)

CURRENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
============================================================

🏗️ SERVICE ECOSYSTEM:
  • API Server:      http://192.168.1.4:5001/api/
  • Camera Stream:   http://192.168.1.4:9000/mjpg
  • Web Interface:   http://192.168.1.4:8080/astra_web_control.html
  • Mobile App:      exp://192.168.1.4:8083

🔌 HARDWARE INTEGRATION:
  • Raspberry Pi 5 16GB (192.168.1.4)
  • Robot HAT with HifiBerry DAC
  • OV5647 camera module
  • HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor (D2/D3)
  • Battery monitoring system

💾 CODE STRUCTURE:
  • /home/spencer/amy_core/mobile_api_server.py (Flask backend)
  • /home/spencer/AmyMobileApp/App.js (React Native frontend)
  • /home/spencer/amy_core/astra_web_control.html (Web interface)
  • /home/spencer/bin/amy_say (TTS script with Robot HAT)
  • /home/spencer/amy_core/start_astra_complete.sh (Startup script)

VALIDATION & TESTING RESULTS:
============================================================

✅ VOICE SYSTEM: 100% functional
   - Wake word detection confirmed
   - Proper Astra voice output verified
   - Audio device stability post-reboot ready

✅ MOBILE APP: Fully operational
   - Connection established and maintained
   - All voice commands tested and confirmed
   - Real-time sensor data flowing correctly
   - Camera feed loading (with refresh capability)

✅ WEB INTERFACE: Production ready
   - Accessible from multiple devices
   - All controls tested and functional
   - Live data updates confirmed
   - Professional appearance and UX

✅ API BACKEND: Stable and responsive
   - All endpoints operational
   - Error handling implemented
   - CORS properly configured
