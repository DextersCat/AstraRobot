🌙 SLEEP STATE FEATURE SPECIFICATION
=====================================

CONCEPT: Add a sleep/wake toggle that complements the existing desk safe mode for intelligent power and resource management.

SLEEP MODE BEHAVIOR:
😴 WHEN SLEEPING:
  - Voice responses disabled (except wake commands)
  - Camera feed paused/dimmed to save resources  
  - Status shows "😴 Astra is sleeping"
  - Still monitors for "Astra wake up" or wake button
  - Sensors continue monitoring but don't announce
  - LED indicators dimmed (if available)

🌅 WAKE TRIGGERS:
  - Manual button press on mobile/web interface
  - Voice command: "Astra wake up" or "Astra activate"
  - Proximity detection (if person comes very close)
  - Scheduled wake time (optional future feature)

UI INTEGRATION:
📱 MOBILE APP:
  - Add sleep toggle button next to desk safe mode
  - Show sleep status with 😴 emoji when sleeping
  - Wake button prominent when in sleep mode
  - Dim interface colors when Astra is sleeping

🌐 WEB INTERFACE:
  - Sleep/wake toggle in control panel
  - Visual indication of sleep state
  - Disabled voice command buttons when sleeping
  - Quick wake button always available

🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
  - Add sleep state variable to API server
  - Modify speak_text() to check sleep state
  - Add /api/sleep endpoint for state control
  - Update mobile and web UIs with sleep controls
  - Preserve desk safe mode as separate safety feature

BENEFITS:
⚡ Power efficiency when not actively needed
🔇 Noise reduction during quiet times  
🎛️ Better user control over Astra's activity level
🛡️ Maintains safety with desk safe mode separation
🌙 Natural day/night cycle adaptation

This complements desk safe mode perfectly:
- Desk Safe Mode = Movement disabled for physical safety
- Sleep Mode = Voice/activity disabled for power/quiet time
