Orchestrators excel at bringing people together and mobilizing them to achieve and exceed expectations.
Typical Orchestrators use their preference for order, attention to detail, precision, and reliability to follow through with what they start,
bringing people together to achieve desired strategies and goals in a synergistic way. They are skilled in connecting to people and
understanding how their gifts and individual personalities can be best tapped into to align with the goals they're charged with meeting.
They identify what makes people special and bring out their very best.
Other distinguishing characteristics include their drive to set ambitious goals and put in place systematic plans to achieve them. That
means they methodically gather and evaluate relevant information, facts, and data and organize it into good plans, and then push through
to ensure those plans produce practical results.
They tend to gravitate toward eﬃcient and reliable solutions and frameworks to solve problems. This may mean that people who are
more unstructured and messy in their thinking style may frustrate them.
Whether it’s planning a life event or solving a business problem, typical Orchestrators are relied on for their ability to bring people and
resources to bear in a reliable and practical way to get things done.
